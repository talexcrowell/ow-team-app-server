### Developer Notes
This project is meant to act as a foundation to structure or inspire future apps. As a true believer of open source and combined efforts, I want developers to have the ability to manipulate my code and maybe give insight on how to solve problems that they are having on personal projects. 

### Instructions to Run App
To run this project, you will need to copy the repository for both the client and server and make sure you are running a local version of mongoDB.<br>
Client: (https://github.com/talexcrowell/ow-team-app-client) <br>
Server:(https://github.com/talexcrowell/ow-team-app-server) <br>
<br>
If you need to import data into your mongo database, I have included seed data for this project and a script to import the seed data (therefore you just have to run ```node seed-database.js```). Please feel free to modify the data and components to fit your project's needs.
